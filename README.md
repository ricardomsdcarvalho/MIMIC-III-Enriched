# MIMIC-III-With-Semantic-Enrichment
MIMIC-III data set, with the patient's information semantic annotations to target ontolgoies.

On the work (https://github.com/Jeffreylin0925/MIMIC-III_ICU_Readmission_Analysis), they make a patient oriented set, where each patient, based on the MIMIC-III data set, has all the instances that describe the stay. Our work, performes a semantic enrichment of the information, resulting is a reacher data set were each patient not only has the instances that describe the stay buy also has annotations for the ontologies that best describe the information. With this, our new files that enrich the patient's information will be shown here. 

This set is structured as sutch:
  - The folders correspond to the patient's ID on the mimic-iii data set, and ca be obtained runing the code on https://github.com/Jeffreylin0925/MIMIC-III_ICU_Readmission_Analysis.
