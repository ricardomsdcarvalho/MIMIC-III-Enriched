# MIMIC-III-With-Semantic-Enrichment
MIMIC-III data set, with the patient's information semantic annotations to target ontolgoies.

Based on the work done on the GithHub (https://github.com/Jeffreylin0925/MIMIC-III_ICU_Readmission_Analysis), we made a patient oriented set, where each patient, based on the MIMIC-III data set, has all the instances that describe theyr stay. To these pateints information, our work performed an enrichment, were now adding to the descriptions of the patient stay we add annotations to target ontologies that improve the descriptive power of the information.

This set is structured as sutch:
  - The folders correspond to the patient's ID on the mimic-iii data set, and ca be obtained runing the code on https://github.com/Jeffreylin0925/MIMIC-III_ICU_Readmission_Analysis.
